## Summary
The system that is currently being modelled is spotify. In this model you are able to complete most of the functions of the regular Spotify app like add albums, add songs to your library, create different playlists, add podcast episodes, remove and add songs to playlists and much more. The user has to first login using the correct information which are username (KyleM21) and password (Hello123). Once the user logs in they are brought to the main menu where they can choose to view different playlists, songs and so on. The main menu allows the user to view all of the songs in their library, all their playlists and albums and the podcasts they have. If the user enters the wrong information more than 5 times the code will stop running much like a regular spotify login. The programs displays information such as song name, the artist, the release date, and which album/playlist it is in. 

Login Info:
Username: KyleM21
Password: Hello123
